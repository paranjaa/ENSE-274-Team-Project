# ENSE-374-Team-Project
## This is the repository for Team Worfâ€™s Group Project. ShareNote is a web app for writing and sharing notes.

As a team we underwent the following stages typical in a software project life cycle:
- Project Initiating & Planning
- Software Design
- Software Construction

The ultimate goal through this exploration was to be able to deliver a Minimum Viable Product, that is in some way useful to our target userbase (ENSE 374 students).
