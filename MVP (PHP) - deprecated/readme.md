# Background

- Initially, the team was naive to how much coding work it would actually take to build out even just a barebones Minimum Viable Product. 
- So Alok began working on a Node.js implementation of the ShareNote app, while I (Khelan) worked on the PHP implementation. 
- Through our inexperienced idealistic lenses, at the time this seemed like a good way to explore which method results in overall better user functionality
 and actual implementation.
- This decision ended up working against us in the end. We learned that splitting our efforts across two different implementations took away from how much
 we would have been able to get done on just one colloborative implementation.
